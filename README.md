# D-examples
Simple examples written in D.  

## `.modules`-files
These files are not required in your work-space, they just contain a list of urls to the modules and dub-packages an example requires to run successfully.  Github links lead to files you will have to copy to the example workspace-directory for the example to work, same with the gitlab links.
